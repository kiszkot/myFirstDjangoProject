# My First Django Project

And a project for a recrutation as an intern or something.

This is a restaurant like API with Chefs that can have many recipes, Restaurants that have recipes, CEOs and names, CEOs that can own restaurants and recipes both meat, vegan and vegetarian.

Superuser endpoints have "admin" in the path. Other endpoints do not.

Not nice user interface.

superuser is admin@admin.com with password "password". Easy to guess, and not so much secure.
